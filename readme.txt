We have used unsupervised learning (K means algorithm) to reduce the number of color points in an
image. This application is also referred to as image segmentation or color quantization.

javac ImageSegmentation.java
java ImageSegmentation

Note :
Place the images in the same folder where you place ImageSegmentaion.java file.
Output images are generated under clusteredImages folder.
